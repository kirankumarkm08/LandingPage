            K-Scale Labs is a machine learning startup building software for the
            next generation of embodied artificial intelligence. Located near
            Stanford in the heart of Silicon Valley, we are a team of engineers
            and researchers with the mission to build a future where billions of
            humanoid robots assist humans with everything from household chores
            to industrial labor. Our first development, Stompy, is an
            open-source bipedal humanoid robot that can be easily manufactured
            by individuals using 3D printing. Stompy is a template low-cost
            humanoid robot that can be customized or used as a reference design.
